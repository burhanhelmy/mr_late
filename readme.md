## Description
This software is used to recover files from hdd with capability to slow down the copy process to recover files that from a damaged hdd/ssd.

I'm facing an issue with my ssd when I try to copy large number of files with normal copy process and the ssd will eventually disconnect and force eject itself. So I decided to create this software to control the copy process.

## Features
- Custom copy speed process
- Stateful copy process to stop and resume
- Filtering date of files to copy
